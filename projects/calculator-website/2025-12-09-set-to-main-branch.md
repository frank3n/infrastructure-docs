Changed default branch using GitHub CLI ✅
  - Used: gh repo edit frank3n/calculator-website --default-branch main
  - Result: Default is now main (instead of the long Claude branch name)

  Why No PR Needed ✅
  - The main branch was created from the Claude branch that already had Phase 2 changes
  - Both branches point to commit 2e113af (your Phase 2 work)
  - Phase 2 changes are already in production on main!

  Your Phase 2 improvements are LIVE! ✅
